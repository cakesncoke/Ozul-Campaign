## Excerpt from the [[Hymn of Bestowal]]
*"Praises unto Alfried Benden, for his courage in defending those not connected to him by land, may the winged lions of Belqris never forget his name. I divest unto thee of my godhood, [[Heavenly Aspects#The Braces of Vain|The Braces of Vain]], So none may overpower you in strength"*
**-Himmlischer Kaiser**

## History
Following the disbandment of the original **Aspect Holders** after the **War of Exodus**, the noble warrior and visionary **Alfried Benden** set sail in search of untainted lands to forge his kingdom. Steering clear of the blood-soaked grounds of his past, Benden ventured far across the seas until he reached a severed land abundant with untouched riches and natural wonders. Here, he established his royal house and, with his trusted council by his side, endeavored to create a utopian kingdom—a realm of prosperity and unity.

Under Benden’s leadership, the kingdom flourished. The people adored their diligent ruler, who fostered a shared sense of purpose and inspired them to build a haven free from the dark memories of the War of Exodus. With prosperity came wealth, and Benden's royal house and council grew opulently rich. This golden age ushered in the dawn of Benden’s arcane studies, with sects devoted to the mysteries of the arcane arts and sciences flourishing under royal patronage.

However, 400 years after the War of Exodus, the council of Benden cast its gaze beyond its borders, directing an ambitious campaign to the Qairan shores. This marked the first attempt at large-scale expansion for the Benden kingdom, fueled by emerging prototypes of arcane war machines that would later define Benden's military prowess. Yet, despite their innovations, the Benden forces suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of the **Qairan Merchant Guilds**. Humiliated, they were forced to cede a portion of their wealth to recompense the damages incurred by the war, which shattered the people’s confidence in their leaders.

This defeat set off a chain of disillusionment. The opulent lifestyles of the royal house became the subject of scandal, and rumors of corruption within the council spread like wildfire. The once-united kingdom began to crack under the weight of greed and internal decay.

In the year 750, desperate to restore loyalty, the kingdom of Benden directed its military toward the **Kezek’ims** to the East. Framed as a righteous conquest, this war reignited Benden’s innovative spark. Artificers and craftsmen toiled tirelessly, creating advanced war machines and modern battleships. Yet, the costly century-long campaign took its toll. As coffers dwindled, soldiers deserted the front lines, leaving battlefields abandoned and the kingdom’s will to fight extinguished.

With the final collapse of the war effort, Benden’s people forsook the royal house and council altogether. Regions splintered, self-governing in the absence of leadership. The once-grand city of Benden, home to its royal house and council, now stands deserted, its walls crumbling and hollow—a silent monument to a kingdom undone by ambition and excess.

## Geography & Climate
The kingdom of **Benden** is a landmass isolated from the other realms by the vast **Sea of ---,** which preserved its untouched riches until the era following the **War of Exodus.** This isolation kept Benden hidden from the reaches of mortal kind, allowing rare resources to flourish within its borders. Rich deposits of precious metals, arcane flora, and ancient deep oils once filled its lands, though most of these treasures have since been depleted. Even so, many believe that hidden troves of wealth lie undiscovered, awaiting those brave enough to seek them.

Benden’s terrain is defined by sprawling plateaus and expansive stretches of forested grasslands. Its shores are rugged, with jagged rocky plains and elaborate salt cave systems that mark the coastline. The exception to this lies to the East, where centuries of war smoothed the cliffs into a level coastline now settled by scattered villages and former fortifications. 

In its early years, Benden boasted the most fertile soils in all of Lorethia, producing an array of exotic crops nurtured through arcanic practices. Farmers of that age cultivated magic-infused fruits and roots, their abundance enhancing the prosperity of the kingdom. Yet, rapid expansion and unsustainable resource extraction left much of Benden’s fertile land burnt or barren, with only a few arable patches now remaining in the rare farm-focused enclaves.

The climate in Benden remains warm and dry across most of the year. Its coastlines, where oceanic breezes bring mild humidity, support diverse flora and fauna not seen inland. Benden’s nights are cooler and gentler than the harsh extremes of Qaira, and winters never touch its soil. Instead, rare rainstorms sweep across the kingdom, leading to joyous celebrations whenever they occur. Legends also speak of great firestorms that once ravaged Benden, though most dismiss these as myth in the present day.
## Traditions & Culture
Once a land renowned for its vibrant culture and community-centered celebrations, **Benden** held a reverence for unity and togetherness that many credit for its early and swift innovation. Festivals, communal gatherings, and sacred rites united Benden’s people under a shared bond that defined their society, fostering cooperation and creativity in all pursuits.

Over time, however, the splendor of Benden’s cultural heritage was squandered. Generations of the royal house grew increasingly decadent, indulging in lavish feasts, extravagant displays, and wasteful extravagances that drained the wealth of the kingdom. This unrestrained opulence came at a high price for the common folk, whose needs were cast aside as the royal family reveled in hypocrisy and excess.

The **Benden Council,** originally established to keep the royal family accountable, devolved into a nest of corruption, mirroring the excesses of the very rulers they were meant to balance. Council members were selected behind closed doors, with positions bought and traded, sealing the council’s separation from the people they claimed to serve. Tasked with managing the kingdom’s treasury, councilors saw an opportunity to enrich themselves, raising taxes to fund their own indulgences while cutting resources meant to support the people of Benden. Each year, the chasm between ruler and ruled grew wider, and resentment deepened.

The kingdom’s decline came to a head in the wake of the century-long war. Disillusioned with both the royal family and the council, Benden’s people renounced their rulers, abandoning centralized authority to form their own self-governing communities. These regions cultivated their own unique traditions, clinging to fragments of Benden’s past culture but adapting them to suit their own needs and beliefs. Though these scattered settlements now hold differing customs and identities, they share a unifying disdain for the royal house and council that betrayed them, and they harbor a lingering shame for the ruinous conflicts they waged against neighboring realms.

Today, Benden is a fractured land, each settlement a remnant of its former unity, with the legacy of the royal house preserved only in the lingering resentment of its people.
