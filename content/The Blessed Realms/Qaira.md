## History
After the great Exodus, Emirhan Qaira rose to prominence, leading a vast nomadic people through lands untamed. Under his guidance, these people forged a legacy, and from it emerged the mighty city of ***Kasira***—now the heart and capital of the Qairan realm.

Though Kasira marked the end of their wanderings, the Qairan people held fast to their nomadic heritage. Driven by curiosity and enterprise, they ranged far and wide within their homeland and ventured even beyond, scattering the seeds of Qairan influence across distant lands. Outposts flourished, each colony branching into a unique identity, bound by shared culture yet distinct in purpose and custom.

With exotic resources abundant throughout the land, Qaira soon saw the rise of merchant pathways, and with them, bustling trade networks that stretched across the realm. Soon, trade became the lifeblood of Qairan society, and in time, settlements flourished as centers of commerce. Ambition swelled, and the people of Qaira turned their minds to the art of trade, seeking fortunes through exchange.

In time, Qaira became the first realm to adopt formalized [[currency]] and the structure of centralized banking, introducing foundational practices such as taxation, loans, and interest. Their scholars devised complex systems of financial law to govern these dealings—later codified by the revered scholar ***Alzahir***—setting a standard for the known realms of Lorethia.

As prosperity grew, the powerful merchant guilds convened to establish a Council of Guilds, aimed at creating cohesion and consistency across markets. This council’s authority was eventually recognized by the sultanate itself, under the condition that guilds contribute a share of their annual wealth to the royal treasury. Thus, Qaira entered an age of unprecedented economic and cultural influence, a beacon of wealth and wisdom throughout Lorethia.

## Geography & Climate
Founded in the far northwestern reaches of the known world, Qaira has its borders stretching across vast expanses of desert and scattered colonies that link back to the ancient capital of **Kasira**, found at the far edge of Qaira’s domain.

When ***Emirhan Qaira***, the founder of this empire, began carving his civilization into existence, he wielded an unparalleled power. It is said that the towering mountains of the north were reduced to fine, golden sands beneath his will, clearing the way for his empire’s foundation. Through his mastery of ***Sayf Al-Samaa’***, he sculpted the landscape to prepare for the ever-growing sprawl of Qaira’s reach. Legend holds that the monumental city of Kasira, seat of the realm’s power, was raised in but a fortnight through the unrestricted might of Sayf Al-Samaa’.

Today, Qaira stands as the third-largest realm by land, with landscapes defined by vast, shimmering deserts and sporadic patches of grasslands. Though it lacks the towering frostbitten peaks of Fjornei or the eerie, blackened valleys of Kezek’im, Qaira boasts a landscape of majestic dunes and sweeping plateaus, as fierce as they are breathtaking.

The climate of Qaira is among the harshest known. By day, the land is scorched by an unrelenting sun, only to be struck by piercing winds once night descends. According to the [[Hymn of Bestowal]], Qaira is also plagued by fearsome sandstorms known as ***Hubar Aswad***. These storms are viewed with a mix of awe and dread by Qairan tribes—some regard them as ill omens, while others believe they cleanse the land of mortal transgressions, purifying the sands in their wake.

## Traditions & Culture
The traditions of Qaira revolve around a singular, unyielding pursuit: the accumulation of wealth. Within Qairan society, a person’s status is measured by their riches, shaping a culture of intense ambition and competition. This drive has created a society both prosperous and disparate; yet, whether highborn or low, every Qairan shares a relentless determination to seek fortune. Begging, seen as the final surrender of one's spirit, is a rare and scorned sight on Qairan streets. To the people of Qaira, the means are secondary to the ultimate goal of wealth, and all are united by their will to earn, barter, or trade their way to prosperity.

The philosophy of wealth permeates Qairan religious life, with grand temples erected in devotion to the **Himmlischer Kaiser**. Each city vies for the Kaiser’s favor, adorning their temples with opulence as a testament to their devotion. Qairan arcane practices are similarly influenced, with rituals that demand the sacrifice of mind and body in the pursuit of material gain. However, though **The Faith** is publicly observed as the realm's enforced religion, this is largely a facade. True Qairan culture remains often areligious, and hidden beneath the surface is a network of underground sects where practices forbidden by the **Church of Oaths** flourish in secret.

Driven by ambition, Qairans are pioneers of innovation, their restless pursuits spurring the creation of new systems, tools, weapons, and even arcane techniques. This inventiveness has propelled Qaira to the forefront of progress, solidifying its reputation as a realm of unceasing advancement and ingenuity.

## The Merchant Council
In the realm of Qaira, governance falls to the esteemed Merchant Council, a body composed of representatives from each of the major merchant guilds. These guilds hold a formidable presence across Qaira, and their interests are steered by the council's guidance. The council convenes in quarterly sessions to address pressing issues and gathers for a grand meeting each year in the final month. This annual gathering is shrouded in secrecy—its exact date and time concealed, and its agenda guarded with utmost discretion. Attendance by the heads of each major guild is compulsory, with royal family members often joining the session; however, no other guests are permitted to attend.

The Merchant Council wields vast influence, setting transaction rates for all Qairan banks and establishing the standard values for goods traded across Qaira’s extensive routes. Each guild is permitted slight flexibility in adjusting prices within its territories, but overarching rates are dictated by council consensus. 

Beyond economic regulation, the council enacts the general laws binding Qairan society. Enforcement of these laws falls to each guild within its own colonies, with representatives from all guilds stationed within each other’s territories to ensure compliance. Matters not covered by council law are left to the discretion of individual guilds, which may resolve them through either established court systems or the direct judgment of guild leaders.

When disputes arise between guilds, they are brought before the sultan, who delivers the final ruling after hearing the appeals from both parties. Within the council itself, disagreements are settled by the sultan’s decree, though his intervention is seldom needed due to the council’s disciplined structure. The Merchant Council thus maintains a delicate balance of power, ensuring both order and prosperity within the vast, competitive world of Qaira’s commerce.

## Merchant Guilds
In Qaira, every community is governed by a merchant guild, which serves as both its protector and administrator. Guilds fall into two categories: major and minor, each with distinct identities and subcultures, reflecting Qaira's rich and varied landscape. There are only 18 major guilds across the realm, each holding vast territories and dominating a specific industry—agriculture, advanced technology, arcane artifacts, and rare minerals among them. However, the **Guild of Aid** and the **Guild of Wisdom** stand apart: the former specializes in providing labor and services, while the latter dedicates itself to knowledge, philosophy, and the sciences.

Major guilds continually expand their territories through conquest and colonization, a practice blessed and sanctioned by the sultane. Proposals for such conquests are submitted to a special court, where the sultane’s approval signals collective investment from other major guilds. Funds are funneled into the initiating guild with the understanding that these loans, with interest, will be repaid once the new holdings are established. Consequently, conquered territories often transform into centers for production or trade, rather than residential communities, leaving much of the non-guild population to dwell deeper within Qaira's interior.

In contrast, minor guilds are smaller and far more varied, often pursuing multiple industries instead of a single specialization. These guilds may operate as close-knit democracies with just a handful of members or as federations of cities ruled by councils. One rule, however, is universal: decisions within Qairan guilds are never left to a single individual. Leadership and governance in Qaira are intrinsically collaborative, ensuring no single voice holds absolute sway over the guild’s course.
