## Excerpt from the [[Hymn of Bestowal]]
*"And finally, honor unto Aegenar Wesmorde, May her name bloom on every tree in Lorethia as a flower brilliant gold. I divest unto thee of my godhood, [[Heavenly Aspects#La Fiamma Eterna|La Fiamma Eterna]], may it bring warmth to your hearts forevermore"*
**-Himmlischer Kaiser**
