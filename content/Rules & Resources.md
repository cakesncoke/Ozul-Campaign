# Core Rules
## Character Creation
### Choose a Class:
**Fill in Hit Die:** (No not Hit Points, we'll get to that)
![[Pasted image 20241101100339.png]]

| Hit Die | Classes                                              |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| d6      | Sorcerer, Wizard                                     |
| d8      | Artificer, Bard, Cleric, Druid, Monk, Rouge, Warlock |
| d10     | Fighter, Paladin, Ranger                             |
| d12     | Barbarian                                            |
The amount of hit die you get is equal to your level. So a level 5 Bard will get 5d8 Hit Die.

**Select Saving Throw Proficiencies:**

| Barbarian | **✔**    |           | **✔**        |        |              |          |
| Bard      |          | **✔**     |              |        |              | **✔**    |
| Cleric    |          |           |              | **✔**  |              | **✔**    |

| Fighter   | **✔**    |           | **✔**        |        |              |          |
| Monk      | **✔**    | **✔**     |              |        |              |          |
| Paladin   |          |           |              | **✔**  |              | **✔**    |
| Ranger    | **✔**    | **✔**     |              |        |              |          |
| Rouge     |          | **✔**     |              |        | **✔**        |          |
| Sorcerer  |          |           | **✔**        |        |              | **✔**    |
| Warlock   |          |           |              | **✔**  |              | **✔**    |
| Wizard    |          |           |              | **✔**  | **✔**        |          |
| Artificer |          |           | **✔**        |        | **✔**        |          |
Saving Throws are calculated by adding proficiency bonus to the respective ability modifier.
So a Level 1 Druid with +3 Wis & +1 Int will have +5 & +3 on the respective saving throws.
**PROFICIENCY BONUS AT LEVEL 1 IS ALWAYS +2**

**Choose Skill Proficiencies:**
Check the Player Handbook for this one or just Google the proficiencies that your class has. Same rules as above apply here.

**Weapon & Armor Proficiencies:**
![[Pasted image 20241101101956.png]]
Again, go to the Player Handbook or Google these proficiencies. When using weapons that you are proficient with, you can add your proficiency bonus to the attack bonus of that weapon. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can’t cast spells.

**Class Equipment:**
![[Pasted image 20241101102437.png]]
Player Handbook or Google. You can either choose to take the equipment or take the GP and buy your own equipment.

**Class Features:**
![[Pasted image 20241101102653.png]]
Its good at this stage to fill in your class features with at least up to your level 3 features. Write these as short points so it doesn't take up too much space. These can also be found in the Player Handbook or by Googling.

#### For Spellcasters:
**Fill in Spellcasting Ability section:**
![[Pasted image 20241101103207.png]]
- Spellcasting Modifier: (Ability Modifier you use to cast spells)
- Spell Save DC: (Proficiency bonus + Spell Modifier + 8)
- Spell Attack Bonus: (Proficiency bonus + Spell Modifier)

**Fill in total spell slots for your current Level**
![[Pasted image 20241101103702.png]]

**Choose your spells:**
![[Pasted image 20241101103753.png]]
[Read more about spells and spellcasting](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Spells#content)
You can wait till you roll ability scores before choosing which spells you'll use but as a general rule its better to choose your spells in this stage.

### Choosing Origin:
#### Choosing a Background:
**Ability Scores:** (Player Handbook or Google)
Each Background gives you 3 Abilities to choose from. After you roll your Ability Scores, you can either choose to improve 2 of the 3 given by +2 and +1 or all 3 of the given by +1.
If you are choosing a background from an older source or homebrew, you can choose to do this for any Ability Score.

**Feats:**
![[Pasted image 20241101104833.png]]
Each Background gives you 1 Origin Feat, and you start out at level 1 with this feat. If you are using older material or homebrew, choose any 1 Feat from the Origin Feats list.
At any level where you can get an ability score improvement (as stated by your class features), you can instead choose a feat instead.

**Skill Proficiencies:**
Same rules apply as when you chose skill proficiencies for your class.

**Tool Proficiency:**
![[Pasted image 20241101105706.png]]
These are always under your background.

**Equipment:**
Same rules as when you chose them for your class.

#### Choosing a Species:
**Size and Speed:**
![[Pasted image 20241101110022.png]]
For most core species, speed is **30ft** and size is **medium**, though check the Player Handbook or Google your Species to make sure.

**Species Traits:**
![[Pasted image 20241101110230.png]]
Always good to write down points for all your species traits. Found in the Player Handbook or Google.
### Rolling Ability Scores:
![[Pasted image 20241101111754.png]]
**Ability Scores** are calculated by rolling 4d6 and taking out the lowest

**Roll Ability Score:** `dice: 4d6kh3`

To calculate **Ability Modifier**: (Ability Score - 10) / 2 
and always round down.

Depending on your class, how you distribute these scores will differ. **So do your research**.

### Filling in the Rest of your Sheet:
**Armor Class and Hit Points:**
![[Pasted image 20241101111141.png]]
- Armor Class (AC): Depends on the armor you have on (at the start this is part of the equipment you get from your class)
- Hit Points (HP): 8 + Con Modifier (At higher levels you roll your Hit Die and add to the total)

**Proficiency Bonus:**
![[Pasted image 20241101112053.png]]

| Proficiency Bonus | Level |
| ----------------- | ----- |
| +2                | 1-4   |
| +3                | 5-8   |
| +4                | 9-12  |
| +5                | 13-16 |
| +6                | 17-20 |
**Initiative:**
![[Pasted image 20241101111601.png]]
This is equal to your Dex Modifier.

**Passive Perception:**
![[Pasted image 20241101111935.png]]
8 + Con Modifier + Proficiency Bonus

**Flavor:**
The rest of your character is just flavor and backstory.
